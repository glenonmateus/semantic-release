## Conventional Commits

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention
> on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating
> an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated
> tools on top of.

This makes your commit messages readable not only to humans but also to bots,
you can now automate releases ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)), automate changelogs, and more.
## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning (also called SemVer) is a specification,
a simple set of rules that dictates how version numbers of your
projects are assigned and incremented.

![SemVer](images/semver.webp)

As per this specification, any version number should be complying with
this structure â€” `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where,

1. MAJOR version is incremented when you make any breaking change
2. MINOR version is incremented when you add a new feature/functionality
3. PATCH version is incremented when you make bug fixes
