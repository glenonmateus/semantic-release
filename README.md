## Conventional Commits

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention
> on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating
> an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated
> tools on top of.

This makes your commit messages readable not only to humans but also to bots,
you can now automate releases ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)), automate changelogs, and more.
